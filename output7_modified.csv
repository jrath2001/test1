Scaffolding was erected while the unit was running with the temperature of the column at approximately 465 degrees F (240 degrees C).The Unit was shut-down over a weekend and after the column temperature had cooled to ambient it was observed that column contraction had been sufficient to affect the scaffold.  Standards (vertical supporting tube members) which were resting on column platforms were noted to be 2-3 inches clear of the platforms, and ledgers (tubes spanning horizontally and tying a scaffold longitudinally) on one side of the scaffold were showing a downward deflection also of 2-3 inches.The scaffold was constructed on all sides of the column and this, along with the request from the refinery Scaffolding Inspector for 7ft. spacing between standards instead of the intended 9ft., provided sufficient support to prevent any major instability which might otherwise have resulted in an accident.",,nearmiss
